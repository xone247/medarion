Although some Nepalis have upheld a model of secularism that would imply no connection between the state and religion, for most it implies that the state should support all religions equally. Through case studies (1) of conversion and the relation of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity to the state and to Hinduism, (2) of diverse Hindu responses to secularism, and (3) of the controversy over animal sacrifices at the Gadhimai festival, the chapter examines the effects of the new concepts, propagated by the state especially since 2015, of secularism and of distinct religions and ethnic groups. download Download free PDF View PDF chevron_right Banishment of the B-word: interpreting ethnic and religious revival among the Tamang people of Nepal Jonathan Samuels European Bulletin of Himalayan Research (EBHR), 2018 Since 1990, an ethnic revival (Toffin 209: 25) in Nepal has seen members of janaj캐ti (indigenous nationalities) campaign for greater recognition and rights for their respective groups. Many anthropologists are strongly opposed to the way that activists project the identities of these groups as historical continuities. Questions about the antiquity and authenticity of their cultural and religious traditions also abound. The focus of this study are the Tamang, one of Nepals largest ethnic minorities. Recent changes in Tamang religious practices are considered within the context of the contemporaneous ethnic revival. After outlining the historical background of the current situation, in which some activists and anthropologists find themselves pitted against one another, this study argues that members of both groups are strangely united in their wish to distance representations of Tamang identity and religious affiliation from associations with Tibet. Hence, avoidance of the b-word: understood either as bod, the Tibetan term for Tibet, or as bho攷션, the Nepali racial epithet derived from it. At issue here, for activist and academic alike, is the assertion of ethnic and cultural autonomy. But both sides representations of the Tamang are weakened by this minimalisation of the b-dimension. In particular, the contention of this study is that the limitations they both impose make it impossible to fully understand Tamang percept", "metadata": {"source_file": "normalized\\dataset.jsonl", "file_size": 12138360, "file_extension": ".jsonl", "created_at": "2025-09-28T01:08:37.234958", "modified_at": "2025-09-28T02:35:33.461432", "extracted_urls": ["https://www.swrktec.org/church", "https://langhamliterature.org/ecclesiology-in-africa", "http://www.ecoliteracy.org/essays/learning-leonardo,", "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6031-9086", "https://dacb.org", "https://doi.org/10.7788/9783412532284.145"], "extracted_emails": ["info@aAccademia.it", "irem.karakoc@deu.edu.tr", "ranapbs@gmail.com"], "word_count": 1734861, "char_count": 11889234, "line_count": 334, "truncated": true}, "created_at": "2025-10-07T00:22:39.767169Z", "quality_score": 0.41552865788536847}
